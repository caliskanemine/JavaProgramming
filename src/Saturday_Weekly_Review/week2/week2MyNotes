-Variables are containers that store data
-String is sequence(sÄ±ra, dizi) of characters

-Variable types:

1-primitive
-numberical primitives: double>float>long>int>short>byte
-boolean
-char

2-non-primitive
-string

how to declare variables:
dataType variableName= data; (assigning variables from right to left!!!)

Variable Naming Rules:
1-Must be unique(inside the same block-method)
2-Lower camelCase
3-We cannot start with numbers
4-We cannot use Java Reserved words
5-For special character _(under score), $(dolar sign) we can start
6-Make it readable and understandable

implicit casting- it is done by compiler(assigning small data type to larger one)

explicit casting-done by developer, done by manually(assigning larger data type to smaller one)
float myFloat=(float) 12.5; ya da float myFloat=12.5F; --default data type for compiler is double, so we have to do casting to tell that it is float!!

string+int - concatenation(2 different data type!!)-firstNumber=10, secondNumber=20->
 firstNumber+" + "+secondNumber+" = "+firstNumber+secondNumber => 10 + 20 =1020 !!!
 10+string+20+string+int+int
 string+20+string+int+int
 string+string+int+int
 string+int+int
 string+int
 string

benefit of using variables:
we declare only one time and we use it with variableName in the next codes,
we can change the data easily by going to variable
but otherwise we have to change the data from all the next codes.
